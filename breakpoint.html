<!--A game made by Erdem Hanay-->
<!--Hello, I made this game to improve my Javascript skills.
I will write comments for each individual aspect I consider worth exploring.
This way I will learn more stuff about it.
I will also try to explain the science behind certain concepts.
The game's name comes from the concept "breakpoint" in programming.
Breakpoint is utilized in the debugging prosess to isolate parts of the code.
This could be achieved through console.log or stopping the program.
I gave this game this concept because
when I was doing a breakpoint for a certain function, I thought to myself
"What would happen if I include this as a game mechanic."
This game mechanic occurs as the "executed commands" section of the game.-->

<!--I think it is best to explain the DOM structure here before moving on to style.css and script.js
DOM (Document Object Model) is the logical structure of a website.
These files could be considered nodes and have certain relations with each other.
Html is the structure of the website, like whats the content and stuff like that.
CSS is the presentation of the website or how the website looks.
JS is the functionality of the website, what can the website do.
You can create relations between those nodes using certain syntaxs.
Thats how a website operates in the simplist term, not considering backend.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--Specifies the document type as HTML5 so the browser parses it as such, not a html tag.-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--Opens the html + specifies the language used in content as english for SEO and accessibility.-->
  <head>
    <!--Opens head tag, it only contains metadata that is not shown in the website directly.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--Spesifies the charachter encoding as UTF-8.-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--Makes the website responsive for mobile usage. width part sets the layout viewport to match the screens width. initial scale sets the initial zoom to 100%-->
    <title>Breakpoint</title>
    <!--Sets the title shown in the browser tab.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="breakpointstyle.css" />
    <!--Links CSS file, rel means relation while href specifies the path.-->
    <link
      rel="icon"
      href="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/cyber-virus-icon-5276653-512.png"
    />
    <!--Sets the favicon of the Website.-->
  </head>
  <!--Closes the head tag-->
  <body>
    <!--Opens the body section which contains all the rendered content.-->
    <h2 class="title">breakpoint<span class="paran">()</span>;</h2>
    <!--Renders a level 2 heading, class allows targeting in the DOM structure, span is used as a wrapper.-->
    <h4 class="logT">Executed Commands</h4>
    <!--Renders a level 4 heading-->
    <div id="logC" class="logC"></div>
    <!--Div is used as a wrapper-->
    <div id="logP" class="logP">
      movePlayer();|drawTrail();|drawEnemies();|drawPoints();|
      drawPlayer();|drawLives();|drawScoreboard();
    </div>
    <canvas id="g-canvas" class="g-canvas"></canvas>
    <!--defines canvas element which is used for 2d or 3d drawing utilizing javascript. id is used for targeting in the DOM structure especially for javascript here.-->

    <script src="breakpointscript.js"></script>
    <!--Links the Javascript file. We usually put this at the end of the page to increase loading times. This position means the Javascript will load after the html and css.-->
  </body>
</html>
<!--closes the html tag.-->
